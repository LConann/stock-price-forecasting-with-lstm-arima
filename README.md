# Neural Stock Prophet

## Abstract
Stock Price Prediction using a machine learning algorithm helps discover the future value of company stock and other financial assets traded on an exchange. Whereas, the existing methods relied highly on model setup and tuning, without considering the variation of data. Also, the machine learning model faces the problems of overfitting and performance limitations. The proposed solution combines several techniques and algorithms to enhance and evaluate the robustness, stability, and interoperability of the stock price prediction algorithm.
+ LSTM model with attention mechanisms
+ Multiplicative Decomposition
+ ARIMA model
+ Risk Parity Portfolio

## Dependencies
You can install all the packages via
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<hr/>

## Instructions
There are lots of parameters required to construct several algorithms. For more details on the parameters, please visit [Parameters](#parameters)

For simple usage, you can just run
```
python3 main.py
```

It is suggested to change different parameters to know the effects  
  
E.g. Timesteps = 30 for dataset construction, window lengths = 252 for multiplicative decomposition, arima order = (2, 0, 2) for ARIMA model construction, and use the historical stock price from 1st January 2012 to 31st December 2022 to train the model, and use the stock price from 1st January 2023 to 31st December 2023 to perform forecasting. 
```
python3 main.py --time_steps=30 --window_lengths=252 --arima_order 2 0 2 --train_date 2012-01-01 2022-12-31 --test_date 2023-01-01 2023-12-31
```

## Sample Output
```
                     Sharpe ratio Max Drawdown Annual return Annual volatility
Predicted Portfolio      6.376220       -1.87%        53.82%             6.80%
True Portfolio           2.061231       -8.44%        53.28%            21.89%
